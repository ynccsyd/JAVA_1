Let's play a game on an array! You're standing at index 0 of an n-element array named game. From some index  i (where 0<=i<n), you can perform one of the following moves:

Move Backward: If cell i-1 exists and contains a 0, you can walk back to cell i-1 .
Move Forward:
If cell i+1 contains a zero, you can walk to cell .
If cell  contains a zero, you can jump to cell .
If you're standing in cell  or the value of , you can walk or jump off the end of the array and win the game.
In other words, you can move from index  to index , , or  as long as the destination index is a cell containing a . If the destination index is greater than , you win the game.

Function Description

Complete the canWin function in the editor below.

canWin has the following parameters:

int leap: the size of the leap
int game[n]: the array to traverse
Returns

boolean: true if the game can be won, otherwise false
Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of queries (i.e., function calls).
The  subsequent lines describe each query over two lines:

The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of  and .
The second line contains  space-separated binary integers (i.e., zeroes and ones) describing the respective values of .
Constraints

It is guaranteed that the value of  is always .

Explanation

We perform the following  queries:

For  and , we can walk and/or jump to the end of the array because every cell contains a . Because we can win, we return true.
For  and , we can walk to index  and then jump  units to the end of the array. Because we can win, we return true.
For  and , there is no way for us to get past the three consecutive ones. Because we cannot win, we return false.
For  and , there is no way for us to get past the one at index . Because we cannot win, we return false.
